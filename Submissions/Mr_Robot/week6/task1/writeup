first setup dhcp server i am using parrot vm for attack which is assinged by ip 10.10.10.2 and two mr.robot vm assigned by ip 10.10.10.3 and 10.10.10.4
launch nmap
nmap -A 10.10.10.4
we see the open ports and running services but result of no use.

 we will launch nikto
type nikto -h 10.10.10.4
we will see robots.txt in result
so 
curl 10.10.10.3/robots.txt
which give key 1 and a .dic file
key1=073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9
